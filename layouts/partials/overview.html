The <em>Center for the Cultivation of Technology</em> is a "backend provider" for the Open Source community. 
Affiliated projects use the legal entity to collect donations and to manage their budgets and assets, while we take care of organizational matters such as accounting, reimbursements and financial reporting.
<p>
<em>The Center</em> aims to become a lightweight scalable fiscal sponsorship "host", much like a "payment processor for unincorporated projects". 
But in most cases, we work closer with projects to identify funding opportunities, provide additional services (together with partner organizations), exchange knowledge about sustainable organizational development, and allow developers to focus on what they do best: write code.

Projects can join based on minimal criteria, and are able to leave and take their assets with them.
The goal is to optimize for self-organization within the project, with minimal "interference" by the host. 
<p>
A lot of the design decisions for <em>The Center</em> are influenced by the primary goal of improving processes and automating workflows for any legal entity that hosts multiple independent projects. We collect and build open source tools that can be used in similar scenarios by other entities, and offer advice to projects with their own legal and organizational setups.
